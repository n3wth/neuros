## Header Inconsistency Issues
1. **Multiple headers**: Each page (Explore, Research, Enterprise, Pricing) has its own header instead of using a shared component
2. **Homepage header**: Different design from other pages
3. **No unified navigation**: Each page reimplements the same navigation

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Priority
1. ✅ Create unified header component (already created: `/components/layout/site-header.tsx`)
2. Replace all individual headers with the unified component
3. Remove broken links or create placeholder pages

### Option 1: Remove Broken Links
Remove all non-essential footer links until pages are created

### Option 2: Create Placeholder Pages
Create simple placeholder pages for all broken links with "Coming Soon" message

### Social Links - FIXED ✅
Removed non-existent social media links since "Neuros Learning" is a template project without real social media presence.
- ✅ Removed Twitter link (account doesn't exist)
- ✅ Removed GitHub link (organization doesn't exist)  
- ✅ Removed Discord link (server doesn't exist)
- ✅ Removed LinkedIn link (company page is for a different organization)

### External API Links - FIXED ✅
- ✅ Updated DiceBear API from v7.x to v9.x (latest version)
