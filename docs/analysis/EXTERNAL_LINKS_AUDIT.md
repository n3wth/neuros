# External Links Audit Report - COMPLETE ANALYSIS

## Summary
After a thorough analysis of ALL links in the codebase, including research papers, social media, APIs, and more, all broken external links have been identified and fixed. The project now contains only valid, working external links or clearly marked example content.

   - Status: Updated to latest version (9.x) ‚úÖ
   - Purpose: Generating user avatars

2. **Research Paper DOI Links** (`components/research/research-page.tsx`)
   - Removed fake DOI links:
     - `https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00812-5` - FAKE, removed ‚ùå
     - `https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2401234121` - FAKE, removed ‚ùå
     - `https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1234` - FAKE, removed ‚ùå
     - `https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.123456` - FAKE, removed ‚ùå
   - Action: Replaced with "Example research paper" text
   - Added comment clarifying these are example papers for demonstration

### ‚ùå Removed Invalid Links

1. **Social Media Links** (`components/landing/trust-indicators.tsx`)
   - Removed: `https://twitter.com/neuroslearning` - Account doesn't exist
   - Removed: `https://github.com/neuroslearning` - Organization doesn't exist
   - Removed: `https://discord.gg/neuros` - Server doesn't exist
   - Removed: `https://linkedin.com/company/neuros` - Points to different company
   - Action: Removed all social links from footer since this is a template project

### üìö Documentation-Only Links (Not Active Code)

1. **Example API in Documentation** (`CLAUDE.md`)
   - `https://api.service.com/warmup` - Example only, not actual code ‚úÖ
   - Purpose: Documentation example for connection warming

2. **Various GitHub Sponsor Links** (`package-lock.json`)
   - Multiple `https://github.com/sponsors/*` links - Part of npm package metadata ‚úÖ
   - Purpose: Package maintainer sponsorship information

3. **npm Registry Links** (`package-lock.json`)
   - Multiple `https://registry.npmjs.org/*` links - Valid package registry URLs ‚úÖ
   - Purpose: Package download locations

## Broken Internal Routes (Separate Issue)

The following internal routes are referenced but don't have corresponding pages:
- `/features`
- `/changelog`
- `/docs`
- `/api`
- `/blog`
- `/about`
- `/careers`
- `/press`
- `/contact`
- `/privacy`
- `/terms`
- `/security`
- `/compliance`
- `/progress`
- `/library`

These are internal routing issues, not external link problems, and should be addressed separately by either:
1. Creating the missing pages
2. Removing the links from navigation
3. Creating placeholder "Coming Soon" pages

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ‚úÖ Searched entire codebase for HTTP/HTTPS URLs
2. ‚úÖ Searched for all href attributes in components
3. ‚úÖ Validated each external URL for accessibility
4. ‚úÖ Checked research page for DOI links - found and fixed fake ones
5. ‚úÖ Updated outdated API versions (DiceBear 7.x ‚Üí 9.x)
6. ‚úÖ Removed non-existent social media links
7. ‚úÖ Verified OpenAI API integration (uses SDK, not direct URLs)
8. ‚úÖ Checked for logo fetching APIs (only in unused script)
9. ‚úÖ Documented all changes

## Recommendations

1. **Add Real Social Links**: When deploying this template for a real project, add actual social media links or remove the social section entirely
2. **Create Missing Pages**: Address the internal broken links by creating the missing pages or removing the links
3. **Monitor API Versions**: Periodically check for updates to the DiceBear API and other external services
4. **Add Link Checking to CI**: Consider adding automated link checking to your CI/CD pipeline

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/avatars.ts` - Updated DiceBear API version
2. `/components/landing/trust-indicators.tsx` - Removed social media links
3. `/components/research/research-page.tsx` - Removed fake DOI links, added clarifying comments
4. `/BROKEN_LINKS.md` - Updated with fix status

## Conclusion

All external links in the codebase have been thoroughly validated and fixed. The project no longer contains any broken external links. Key fixes include:
- Updated DiceBear API to latest version (9.x)
- Removed fake DOI links from research papers
- Removed non-existent social media links
- Clarified that research papers are examples

The remaining issues are internal routing problems (missing pages) which should be addressed based on project requirements.
