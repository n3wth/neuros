# Improve loading screen to match homepage fun vibe

## Problem
The current loading screens throughout the app don't match the playful, engaging personality established on the homepage. Loading states should feel delightful rather than boring.

## Current State
- Basic loading spinners or generic loading indicators
- Doesn't reflect the app's brand personality
- Missing opportunity to engage users during wait times

## Proposed Solution
Create loading experiences that match the homepage's fun vibe:

### Loading Animation Ideas
- **Brain-themed**: Animated brain icon with neurons firing/connecting
- **Learning-themed**: Cards flipping, knowledge flowing, or spaced repetition visualization
- **Playful elements**: Bouncing elements, smooth animations, maybe subtle humor
- **Progress indication**: Show what's happening ("Preparing your cards...", "Optimizing your learning path...")

### Contextual Loading Messages
- "Brewing your perfect learning session..."
- "Your brain is getting ready to learn..."
- "Optimizing spaced repetition magic..."
- "Loading your knowledge journey..."
- "Preparing cards with AI precision..."

### Technical Improvements
- Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
- Skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Progressive loading where appropriate
- Consistent loading patterns across the app

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create branded loading animation that matches app personality
- [ ] Implement contextual loading messages
- [ ] Apply new loading design consistently across app
- [ ] Ensure loading states feel fast and engaging
- [ ] Test on slow connections to ensure good experience
- [ ] Maintain accessibility (respect reduced-motion preferences)
- [ ] Loading animation should be scalable and work on all device sizes

## Technical Notes
- Consider using Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implement proper loading state management
- Ensure animations don't impact performance
- May need to create different loading states for different contexts
