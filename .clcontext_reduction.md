# Context Reduction Strategy

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Clean up .conductor directories
```bash
# Remove all .conductor experiment builds
rm -rf .conductor/

# Or if you need to keep experiments, at least clean builds:
find .conductor -name ".next" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find .conductor -name "node_modules" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find .conductor -name "package-lock.json" -exec rm {} +
```

### 2. Use CLAUDE_COMPACT.md instead
- Rename current CLAUDE.md to CLAUDE_FULL.md for reference
- Use CLAUDE_COMPACT.md (135 lines vs 1,075 lines)
- This saves ~940 lines of context per conversation

### 3. Add .claudeignore file
Create `.claudeignore` to exclude files from context:
```
.conductor/
*.lock
package-lock.json
.next/
build/
dist/
coverage/
*.log
```

### 4. Use /clear command frequently
- Clear context between unrelated tasks
- Start fresh conversations for new features

### 5. Use agents for search tasks
- Instead of reading multiple files, use Task tool with agents
- They operate in separate context, saving your main context

## Why Context Is Being Consumed

1. **CLAUDE.md files are too verbose** (1,835 lines total)
2. **Conductor experiments** add noise when searching
3. **Package-lock files** (10,423 lines each) get included
4. **Reading full files** instead of specific sections

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Keep CLAUDE.md under 200 lines**
2. **Use .claudeignore aggressively**
3. **Clean build artifacts regularly**
4. **Use agents for exploration tasks**
5. **Be specific with file paths to avoid broad searches**
