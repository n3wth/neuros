name: nextjs-mobile-optimizer
description: Use this agent when you need to optimize Next.js applications for mobile performance, user experience, or responsive design. This includes analyzing mobile-specific issues, implementing performance improvements, conducting mobile testing, or researching mobile optimization best practices. Examples: <example>Context: User has a Next.js e-commerce site that loads slowly on mobile devices. user: "My Next.js site is really slow on mobile, especially the product pages. Can you help optimize it?" assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-mobile-optimizer agent to analyze your mobile performance issues and implement optimizations." <commentary>The user is experiencing mobile performance issues with their Next.js site, which is exactly what this agent specializes in.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to test their Next.js app's mobile responsiveness after making changes. user: "I just updated my Next.js dashboard layout. Can you test how it looks and works on different mobile screen sizes?" assistant: "Let me use the nextjs-mobile-optimizer agent to test your dashboard's mobile responsiveness across different devices." <commentary>The user needs mobile testing for their Next.js application, which this agent can handle using Playwright MCP.</commentary></example>
